## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Lung Disease Detection seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### Where to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via:
- **Email**: [Contact through GitHub repository]
- **Private Security Advisory**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:
- Type of vulnerability
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the vulnerability
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Detailed Response**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity and complexity

### Disclosure Policy

- We will respond to your report within 48 hours
- We will provide regular updates about our progress
- We will work with you to understand and resolve the issue
- We will publicly acknowledge your responsible disclosure (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)
- We will release a security advisory once a fix is available

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Measures

1. **Input Validation**
   - File type validation (PNG, JPG, JPEG only)
   - File size limits (recommended < 5 MB)
   - Image format verification

2. **CORS Protection**
   - Configured allowed origins
   - Restricted to specific domains

3. **Django Security**
   - CSRF protection enabled
   - SQL injection prevention (Django ORM)
   - XSS protection enabled

### Known Limitations

**Current Development Version:**
- No authentication/authorization system
- No rate limiting
- Debug mode enabled
- Secret key in version control (development only)
- No HTTPS enforcement

**For Production Deployment:**

These issues MUST be addressed:

1. **Authentication Required**
   ```python
   # Implement user authentication
   # Use Django's built-in authentication or JWT
   ```

2. **Disable Debug Mode**
   ```python
   # In settings.py
   DEBUG = False
   ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your-domain.com']
   ```

3. **Secure Secret Key**
   ```python
   # Use environment variables
   SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')
   ```

4. **Enable HTTPS**
   ```python
   SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT = True
   SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE = True
   ```

5. **Rate Limiting**
   ```python
   # Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   # Use django-ratelimit or similar
   ```

6. **File Upload Security**
   ```python
   # Implement virus scanning
   # Validate file contents, not just extensions
   # Use secure file storage (S3, etc.)
   ```

### Secure Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Change `SECRET_KEY` to a secure, random value
- [ ] Set `DEBUG = False`
- [ ] Configure `ALLOWED_HOSTS` properly
- [ ] Enable HTTPS with valid SSL certificate
- [ ] Implement user authentication
- [ ] Add rate limiting to API endpoints
- [ ] Set up proper CORS configuration
- [ ] Configure secure session/cookie settings
- [ ] Implement file upload validation and scanning
- [ ] Set up logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates for dependencies
- [ ] Database backup and recovery plan
- [ ] Implement input sanitization
- [ ] Add request size limits
- [ ] Configure proper error handling (don't expose stack traces)

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers

1. **Keep Dependencies Updated**
   ```bash
   # Regularly update Python packages
   pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
   
   # Update Node packages
   npm update
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```python
   # Never commit sensitive data
   # Use .env files (add to .gitignore)
   from decouple import config
   SECRET_KEY = config('SECRET_KEY')
   ```

3. **Input Validation**
   ```python
   # Always validate and sanitize user input
   def validate_image(file):
       # Check file type
       # Check file size
       # Verify actual image content
       pass
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```python
   # Don't expose internal errors to users
   try:
       process_image(file)
   except Exception as e:
       logger.error(f"Processing error: {str(e)}")
       return JsonResponse({'error': 'Processing failed'}, status=500)
   ```

#### For Users

1. **Image Privacy**
   - Only upload de-identified medical images
   - Remove patient information before upload
   - Don't upload images containing personal data

2. **Network Security**
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Verify SSL certificate
   - Use secure networks (avoid public WiFi)

3. **Data Handling**
   - Images are temporarily stored during processing
   - Clear browser cache after use
   - Don't upload sensitive data in development version

### Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Initial response and triage
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and fix development
4. **Day 7-14**: Testing and validation
5. **Day 14-30**: Release patch and security advisory
6. **Day 30+**: Public disclosure (if applicable)

### Security Updates

Security patches will be released as:
- **Critical**: Within 24-48 hours
- **High**: Within 7 days
- **Medium**: Within 30 days
